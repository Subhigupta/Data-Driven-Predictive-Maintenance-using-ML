        <h4>Objective of the project</h4>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;">
          Objective of the problem was to develop predictive maintenance classification models using 
          machine learning techniques to predict equipment failures in an industrial setting  before they occur, 
          thereby enabling proactive maintenance interventions, minimizing downtime, reducing maintenance costs, 
          and maximizing operational efficiency.
